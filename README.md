# odin-recipes
This is my first standalone html project.
In this project my goal is to create basic html page that will show cooking recipes. In this project I will be using only HTML. By completing this project I will be showing that I know and that I understand how tu use html elements and atributes, and that I'm able to upload my project on Github.
